# Mathematical Study on Preservative Proportion

We tested each preservative against the selected bacterial strains to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration values. Through systematic testing of different concentrations, we identified the optimal amount of each preservative needed to effectively inhibit bacterial growth while ensuring compliance with current food safety regulations.  The study provides a pathway for future exploration of preservative compounding with data models to optimize its effectiveness against bacterial growth leading to food spoilage.
