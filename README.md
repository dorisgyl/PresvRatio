# Mathematical Study on Preservative Proportion

### Brief introduction
This is a source code for exploring the proportion of food preservatives, used as an appendix to academic papers: “The effect of common food preservatives on the growth of bacteria ” which submitted to "Journal of Emerging Investigators", but also to provide you with a method guide, so that you can use this method to repeat the experiment.

### The following is an introduction to the paper and the project
1. Purpose: Determine optimal preservative combinations through data modeling and biochemical experiments

2. Test subjects:
   - Bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus subtilis
   - Preservatives: sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite, vitamin E, sodium bisulfite, (sodium nitrate)

3. Key findings:
   - Single preservatives were generally inadequate; vitamin E showed poor effectiveness
   - Best inhibitors for each bacterium:
    Staphylococcus aureus: sodium benzoate and sodium nitrite
   Staphylococcus aureus: sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite
    bacillus subtilis: sodium bisulfite, sodium benzoate

4. Methodology: Combined minimum inhibitory concentration testing with data modeling (Linear regression and Linear optimization model) and literature review

5. Significance: Established framework for optimizing preservative combinations within food safety regulations

6. The graph produced by the model:
